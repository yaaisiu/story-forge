description: Story Forge PR review — a thorough correctness/bug-finding pass PLUS the project-specific lens (spec & plan fidelity, layering, §6.7 security gaps, test discipline, portfolio hygiene, merge-readiness). Loads the diff + the spec/plan/CLAUDE.md context a generic reviewer lacks, then reports findings grouped by severity. Report-only — it recommends, it never merges. Run on the current branch's PR (or local branch diff) as your own-review — the primary review gate.

# Review a Story Forge PR

This is the **"your own review"** step the merge flow requires (root `CLAUDE.md` →
*Merge flow*): feature branch → PR → CI → **fold review notes** → squash-merge. There is no
automated second reviewer (the GitHub-wired Codex PR review was retired 2026-06-24), so this
skill is the **primary review gate** — and for *substantive* code, run the heavier multi-agent
`/code-review` in addition. This pass brings two things a generic reviewer doesn't have:
(1) a deliberate correctness/bug hunt, and (2) the Story Forge lens — our spec, our layering,
our security baseline, our test and hygiene rules.

**Two standing rules for this skill:**

- **Report-only. It recommends; it never merges, pushes, or edits the code under review.**
  Findings go to the user, grouped by severity; the user decides what to fold in.
- **Be concrete or say nothing.** Every finding cites `file:line` and the specific rule or
  bug it touches. "Looks fine" is not a finding; "could be cleaner" without a reason is
  noise. A clean section is a *valid, valuable* result — say so explicitly.

Work through the steps in order. Don't eyeball where a `grep`/command can be exact.

## 0. Load context (the part generic reviewers skip)

- **The diff.** If a PR exists for the branch: `gh pr diff <N>` (and `gh pr view <N>` for
  the description + CI state). No PR yet: `git diff main...HEAD` and `git log main..HEAD`.
  Identify every file touched and *why the PR says* it's touched.
- **The spec.** Open the `story-forge-poc-spec.md` section(s) the PR implements or amends
  (the PR body / commit usually names them). The spec is the source of truth.
- **The plan.** Read the current-session tasks and the **Decided** / **Blocked** entries in
  `docs/PLAN_SHORT.md` — the PR must honor decisions already made (or justify changing them).
- **The conventions.** Read the directory-level `CLAUDE.md` for every area the diff touches
  (`backend/`, `backend/src/story_forge/`, `frontend/`, …) plus the root `CLAUDE.md`.

State the change in one sentence before reviewing it. If you can't, that's finding #1.

## 1. Correctness & bug-finding pass (the deliberate hunt)

Read the changed code as an adversary looking for what breaks. Don't just confirm the happy
path the tests assert — find the cases nobody wrote a test for. Check, concretely:

- **Logic & control flow** — off-by-one, inverted conditions, wrong boundary (`<` vs `<=`),
  early return skipping cleanup, unreachable branches, loop that retries with identical
  inputs (does the retry actually *do* anything different?).
- **Dispatch-level confusion in nested structures** — when code branches on a property at
  one level of a tree (e.g. `if chapter.title is None`), check that the invariant being
  preserved isn't at the *neighboring* level. The hybrid-chunking bug (PR #13) dispatched
  on chapter-untitled and re-LLM'd the whole span, silently discarding an explicitly-titled
  scene the author put *before* the first chapter heading (an explicit child of an implicit
  parent). Walk one level past the branch you wrote.
- **Edge / empty / malformed inputs** — empty string/list, `None`/`null`, zero, missing
  dict keys, unexpected types, oversize input, non-UTF-8 bytes, duplicate or out-of-range
  values (e.g. a `paragraph_range` that overlaps, reverses, or skips paragraphs).
- **Error handling** — exceptions caught too broadly or too narrowly; the wrong exception
  type expected (does `model_validate_json` raise what the `except` actually catches?);
  errors swallowed; a failure path that leaves state half-written (e.g. file on disk but DB
  rolled back — recall the orphaned-sandbox cross-cutting note).
- **Async / resource** — un-awaited coroutine, blocking call in async code, client/connection
  not closed, shared mutable state across requests, ordering assumptions between awaits.
- **Data integrity** — IDs generated/used consistently across the Postgres/Neo4j split;
  `order_index` renumbering; transactions committed/rolled back on the right paths.
- **Shared-helper reuse — does the data the helper reads hold for the NEW caller?** When a PR
  routes an existing shared helper (or pure domain function) to a *new* consumer, its **output**
  contract can be satisfied while a **precondition the old caller happened to maintain** is
  silently unmet for the new one. Find every field/state the helper reads and confirm it is kept
  correct at the *new* call site, not just the old. This is structurally hard for a single
  self-review (it can't trace call sites as systematically as the multi-agent cross-file tracer),
  so check it deliberately — it is exactly where helper consolidation (the rule-of-three) plants
  bugs. (PR #76: `committed_entity_id` read `candidates.target_entity_id`; the accept path never
  persisted the *changed* merge target onto the row — harmless for the old terminal-noop reader,
  but the new relation-endpoint-resolution reader resolved to the **stale** target → an edge to
  the wrong entity. `/code-review`'s cross-file tracer caught it; the single self-review missed it.)
- **Checkpoint / resume-marker ordering** — when a persisted write doubles as a *done /
  resume marker* (a row whose presence makes a re-run *skip* that unit of work), verify it
  lands **only after every operation whose completion it certifies** has succeeded. A marker
  written mid-sequence lets a *later* step fail and leave a "done" record over incomplete
  work that the resume path then skips forever — silent, permanent data loss. Enumerate
  **each** inter-write failure window separately, not just the first: with writes A → B → C
  where C is the checkpoint it's the A→B and B→C gaps that bite; analysing only A→B (and
  judging it benign) misses a non-benign B→C. (M2.S4 PR #48: the `entity_mentions` row was
  the resume checkpoint but was written *before* the Neo4j relation write, so a transient
  relation-write failure left a checkpointed paragraph with its relations lost forever — a
  real bug **both** this skill's pass and `/code-review` missed; external review caught it.
  The fix: write the checkpoint last. Self-review had even noted the entity→mention window
  but framed it benign and never examined the mention→relation window.)
- **External I/O contracts** — request/response shape vs the real API (Ollama `/api/chat`,
  psycopg, httpx); headers, timeouts, status handling; what happens on a 4xx/5xx/timeout.
- **Output-schema strength** — does the Pydantic/validation schema for LLM (or any external)
  output actually *enforce its invariants*, or does a **parseable-but-malformed** response
  (negative/reversed range, out-of-domain enum, empty required list, **blank required string**)
  validate as **success** and silently skip the retry path? Constrain what the type can express,
  don't just name it. **Check validator symmetry:** when a schema validates *one* field for an
  invariant (a non-empty `field_validator`, a `ge`/`le` range, a regex), audit **every sibling
  field that shares the same semantic** for the same guard — an unvalidated sibling lets degenerate
  output pass as success while its validated neighbour looks like the rule is covered. (PR #42: the
  `ExtractionProposal` validated non-empty `candidate_name` but **not** the structurally-identical
  relation `subject`/`predicate`/`object`, so `{"subject":"","predicate":"","object":""}` validated
  as success — the gap slipped *both* the `/review-pr` and `/code-review` passes; external review
  caught it.)
- **Failover / retry / error-discrimination code** — enumerate *every* error class the call
  can raise and check each reaches its intended branch. Two failure modes recur: (a) **caught
  too narrowly** — a whole class slips through unhandled (un-recorded, un-retried). For HTTP
  clients that means `httpx.RequestError`/`ConnectError`/`ReadTimeout` (transport/timeout), not
  just `HTTPStatusError` (a returned status); a handler that only catches the latter drops every
  network failure on the floor. (b) **Terminal/exhaustion branch classifies by the wrong thing**
  — "all providers failed" must be reported by the *actual* cause, not a blanket label: don't
  cry "quota exhausted / pause-and-ask" when the tier died on a bad key (401) or an outage (5xx).
  Walk the loop's fall-through and ask "which causes land me here, and does each get the honest
  outcome?" (M2.S2 router, PR #36: both bugs shipped — `RequestError` uncaught, *and* every
  exhausted `cloud_free` tier mislabelled "quota" regardless of cause — Codex caught both, this
  skill's first pass missed both.) (c) **A fail-closed `except` that catches the agent's give-up
  error but not the error classes the router *propagates past* it.** When code fail-closes on an
  LLM agent — catching its give-up error (`JudgeError`, `ExtractionError`) to route to the human
  instead of crashing — `validate_with_retry` only raises that give-up error on *schema* give-up;
  the router's terminal **transport/envelope** failures (`httpx.HTTPError`, `ProviderResponseError`)
  propagate *raw*. So a `except JudgeError` lets "provider unreachable" escape the fail-closed branch
  and crash/502 the batch — the opposite of fail-closed. Check that either the agent's give-up error
  is *total* (it wraps transport→give-up; see `backend/src/story_forge/AGENTS.md` Agents) or the
  consumer's `except` also names `(ProviderResponseError, httpx.HTTPError)` — while still letting
  `Budget`/`Quota` propagate as the pause signal. (M3.S4a PR #63: the cascade caught only `JudgeError`,
  so a judge outage 502'd the batch; `/review-pr` missed it, multi-agent `/code-review` caught it.)

For each suspected bug: state the input that triggers it and the wrong outcome. If you're
unsure it's real, say so and how to confirm — don't drop it, don't overstate it.

## 2. Spec & plan fidelity

- Does the change do what the **spec** section says — no more, no less? Flag silent
  divergence from the spec that did **not** go through the stop-and-amend flow.
- If the PR **amends** the spec: is the amendment actually present, justified, and are
  `docs/PLAN_SHORT.md` / `docs/PLAN_LONG.md` reconciled with it? Plans, spec, code must not drift.
- Does it honor the session's **Decided** entries (e.g. a chosen library, threshold, tier
  default)? A contradiction of a recorded decision is blocking unless the PR re-decides it.
- **LLM-agent prompt: diff the rendered fields against the spec's Appendix C template, not
  just the §3 prose.** An agent's prompt is specified in two homes — the §3 functional prose
  and the **Appendix C** concrete template — and Appendix C is the authoritative, complete
  field set. For a PR that adds/changes a prompt, enumerate the fields the matching Appendix C
  block lists and confirm each is rendered (and test-asserted to reach the model); a field the
  prose summarises but C spells out is the silent omission. (M3.S3 PR #60: the judge prompt was
  built from §3.3 prose and dropped C.3's existing-entity `aliases` + candidate `type`/`properties`;
  the single `/review-pr` pass missed it, the multi-agent `/code-review` caught it. Authoring-side
  mirror: `backend/src/story_forge/AGENTS.md` Prompts.)
- **Absolute-quantifier check — a spec amendment's "always / every / never / all" must match
  the code's exception path.** When the PR adds or edits a spec/invariant sentence containing an
  absolute quantifier ("*always* recorded", "*every* call", "*never* null", "*all* rows carry X"),
  grep the implementation for the exception that quantifier silently excludes: the **nullable
  field** (`X | None`, a nullable column, a `?`-typed client field), the **early return / guard**
  that skips the work, the **default that stays unset**. Confirm the quantifier actually holds on
  *every* path — or weaken the wording to name the exception. The spec is the source of truth, so
  an over-strong quantifier makes the honest implementation read as non-compliant and invites a
  later "fix" that fabricates a value. (PR #51: spec §6.6 said `latency_ms` is "always recorded",
  but the router records `None` for a pre-dispatch budget refusal — and the column / `int | None` /
  the generated `number | null` were all nullable; `/review-pr` noted the None-on-refusal behaviour
  and `/code-review` flagged the clock wording, but **neither connected the "always" claim to the
  nullable exception** — external review caught it. The fix was the wording, not the code.)

### Decision reconciliation — the whole-repo, every-home sweep (the six-pass lesson)

When a PR **records or resolves a decision** — flips a doc `proposed → accepted`, amends the
spec, lands an ADR, overturns an earlier choice — the defect is almost never the new statement;
it is the **stale old statement left somewhere else**. One decision changes a fact that lives in
many homes, and reconciling the *authoritative* home (e.g. spec §6.5) is **not** reconciling the
decision. This class bit a single PR **six consecutive Codex passes** (M2.S2 router decisions,
PR #34) because each fix was scoped too narrowly. Verify by **exhaustive grep over the whole
repo, not the diff's touched files**:

- **Every home of the fact.** Enumerate and grep each: the spec (*all* sections, not just the
  amended one — the §-summaries, hardware tables, roadmap, setup/key lists), `README.md`, *every*
  `AGENTS.md`, both plan files, the `architecture/` vault. The keyword the new decision uses
  (`OpenRouter`, `pause-and-ask`) finds the easy ones.
- **A changed API *shape* has code consumers, not just doc homes — and regenerating the typed
  client is not reconciling them.** When the PR renames/adds/removes a backend route's request or
  response field, the regenerated `frontend/src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` updates the *types* but every
  hand-written usage — hooks, components, and especially **test fixtures** that build the old shape —
  still references the gone field and fails `tsc` (the frontend `build`, not lint). `grep -rn
  "<old_field>\|<new_field>" frontend/src` and reconcile each hit. Confirm `openapi.json` +
  `schema.d.ts` were regenerated *and* committed together (one without the other is drift). (M3.S4a
  PR #63: `ExtractResponse` field rename left three frontend test fixtures on the old names — green
  locally, red in CI; authoring-side mirror: `frontend/src/lib/api/AGENTS.md`.)
- **A frontend status-code branch carries an *assumed contract* — verify each status against the
  backend route, don't trust a sibling feature's mapping.** When the PR adds/changes a hook or
  component that branches on an HTTP **status code** (an error-message mapper, a retry decision, a
  4xx/5xx discriminator), open the backend route it calls (`backend/src/story_forge/api/`) and
  confirm what each status *means there* — the generated `schema.d.ts` names the declared statuses
  but not their semantics, so a mapper copy-adapted from a sibling feature silently inherits the
  **wrong** meaning when the new route uses the same code differently. Then check the **test fixture**:
  a fabricated error body (`jsonResponse(409, {detail:"…"})`) that the route never actually returns
  validates a fiction and makes the broken mapping pass green — match the fixture to a real
  status+detail. Listing "409 surfaces an error" as checked-clean *without opening the route* is not
  a check. (PR #78: `decideMessage` mapped 409→"already decided", but the decide route returns 409
  for a stale/held endpoint and already-decided is a 200; the test stubbed a 409 body the backend
  never sends, masking it — the single `/review-pr` missed it, `/code-review` caught it.
  Authoring-side mirror: `frontend/src/lib/api/AGENTS.md`.)
- **Tracking / registry / navigation / status notes describe the fact in *different words*, so a
  keyword grep misses them — check them by hand.** ADR registries and "existing docs" lists (do
  they name the new ADR?); priority queues / "next steps" (is completed work still listed as
  pending?); as-built or error-handling snapshots (is a resolved item still "an open decision"?);
  doc pointers ("read ADR X" — is it the superseded one?).
- **An accepted/resolved artifact must read resolved *throughout its body*, not just a top
  banner.** Grep the file for residual `open` / `I propose` / `proposed` / "TBD" / imperative
  "build X" / rejected-option language. For a design doc, check the *diagram, config lists, and
  edge-case enumeration* too — they each restate the plan. Banner-plus-spot-fixes is a half-measure.
- **Dated artifacts (reports, sweeps, snapshots) whose findings got resolved** must say so at the
  top, and their `status:` / any "latest/current" framing must match — else a point-in-time record
  masquerades as live state.
- **Leave genuine history intact.** Append-only records — ADR original text under a superseded
  annotation, `CHANGELOG`/`learning-log` entries, a struck plan item, a review's accurate scope
  reference — are *correct as-is*; don't "fix" history into the present.
- **When THIS PR flips a proposal/ADR `proposed → accepted` (or resolves a register), its stalest
  homes are the ones the *same author wrote earlier* describing it as open** — and a keyword grep for
  the *decision* misses them because they describe the proposal's *status*, not its content. Two are
  near-guaranteed: (a) the **navigation notes** — the vault `INDEX.md` proposal-table row *and* its
  "Next steps" list still say "proposed / register OPEN / awaiting owner"; (b) the **plan task** the
  decision changes — e.g. a field-name decision (`candidate_name` over `canonical_name`) leaves the
  `docs/PLAN_SHORT.md` session task telling the implementer the *old* field, so a plan-first build
  writes the wrong code. So: grep the **proposal's own slug + status words** (`proposed`, `OPEN`,
  `register OPEN`, `awaiting owner`, "when accepted", "when M2.Sx lands") across `INDEX.md` + both
  plan files, and **diff each new decision against the task that implements it**. (PR #39: the
  self-review claimed §2 clean but missed exactly the INDEX row, the next-steps, and the Session-3
  `canonical_name` task — external review caught all three.) **Grep the register/OQ *id* (e.g. `OQ-18`),
  not just the slug — and use `grep -A2/-B2` context.** In a *wrapped multi-line* list entry the slug
  and the `OPEN`/`proposed` word land on **different lines**, so a line-scoped grep keyed only on the
  slug never sees the stale line; the **id tends to co-occur with the status word** on that line, so it
  catches what the slug misses. (Session 25: a manual §2 sweep keyed on `m3s4c` passed a stale
  `INDEX.md` "register OQ-18 **OPEN**" line as clean — the slug was on the line above; the `/review-pr`
  re-run, which grepped `OQ-18`, caught it.)

This **subsumes the deferred vault/docs-PR lens** (no-duplication of sources of truth +
tense-vs-as-built honesty): same discipline, same verify-by-grep. The reliable move is to run the
sweep **proactively before claiming clean** — reacting spot-by-spot is what turned one PR into six
rounds.

## 3. Karpathy discipline (root `CLAUDE.md` §1)

- **Simplicity** — minimum code for the problem. Flag speculative features, abstractions for
  single-use code, configurability nobody asked for, dead config (a `Settings` field/knob
  with no reader). **Count both sides** when weighing a small abstraction: noise it *adds*
  (a new class/file) vs noise it *removes* (type-ignores, repeated boilerplate, branches).
  An abstraction that net-removes existing debt is a refactor, not speculation — simplicity
  argues *for* it, not against. (Story Forge example: a `Protocol` that replaces a concrete
  class type and drops a dozen `# type: ignore[arg-type]` markers in tests.)
- **Surgical** — no "improvements" to adjacent untouched code, no opportunistic refactors.
  Every changed line should trace to the PR's stated purpose; flag drive-by edits.

## 4. Layering & architecture (`backend/src/story_forge/CLAUDE.md`)

Mostly grep-able — verify, don't assume:

- `domain/` imports nothing from `api/`, `agents/`, or `adapters/` (pure, no I/O).
- `agents/` import the **`LLMProvider` Protocol**, never a concrete adapter (`OllamaProvider`,
  `httpx`, `neo4j`, `psycopg`).
- `api/` routes are thin — no business logic, no direct DB/graph access; go through domain.
- **FastAPI routes declare every non-2xx outcome they raise.** Every `HTTPException` a route
  raises (or maps from a domain exception) must have a matching entry on the decorator's
  `responses={status: {"model": ErrorResponse, "description": "..."}}` — otherwise the
  OpenAPI schema shows only the success status + the auto-added 422 validation error, and
  the generated TypeScript client (`frontend/src/lib/api/schema.d.ts`) can't model the
  failure paths it must handle. Walk every `raise HTTPException(...)` and every
  `except ...: raise HTTPException(...)` in the route body and verify the status code
  appears in `responses=`. The hand-rolled 422 case (where a domain error is mapped to 422
  with a `{detail: str}` body) is the one trap: declaring it would clobber FastAPI's
  validation typing — either remap to a different status, or leave 422 alone and document
  the overload as a cross-cutting follow-up.
- **Prompts live in `prompts/` as `.j2`**, never inline f-strings in agent code.
- **LLM output is always Pydantic-validated and retried** — no raw JSON trusted, and the
  schema is *strict* (step 1: malformed-but-parseable must fail, not pass).
- **Prompt construction is injection-safe** — untrusted text (an uploaded story, user input)
  rendered into a prompt must not be able to alter the prompt's *structure*: forge role
  markers / extra turns, escape its delimiter, or inject control tokens. Never recover
  structure (roles, sections) by reparsing output that was rendered **together with**
  untrusted content — derive structure from the trusted template, then render content into
  it. Treat "we interpolate user/document text into a prompt" as a finding to chase, not a
  feature to wave through.

## 5. Security baseline §6.7 — the gaps CI can't catch

CI already gates dep-age/exact-pins, Trivy image scans, detect-secrets, npm audit, **and the
backend SCA gate** (`osv-scanner` vs `backend/uv.lock`, fail-on-any). **Don't re-litigate
those** — spot the things those tools miss:

- An API key / `Authorization` / `X-API-Key` value that reaches a log line.
- A **functional** value in `.env.example` (must be a non-working placeholder).
- Any handling of `.env` / `backend/.env` by the agent (forbidden — must be user-managed).
- A new service/bind that isn't `127.0.0.1`-only, a root container, a wildcard CORS origin,
  a telemetry/analytics import.
- A **prompt-injection vector** — untrusted document/user text reaching the model in a way
  that can change the prompt's control structure (the structural check is step 4; flag any
  new prompt path that interpolates untrusted content so it gets that scrutiny).
- A new package/image pin that *slipped past* CI framing (e.g. added but not actually
  scanned, or an image tag change without the `/pin-image` waiver bookkeeping).
- A **Trivy waiver rationale that names the wrong code path.** When a PR adds or modifies
  a CVE entry in `infra/trivy/*.trivyignore` or `WAIVERS.md`, verify each CVE's *package
  attribution* against an authoritative source — `pkg.go.dev/vuln/<GO-id>` for Go
  ecosystem, `nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/<CVE-id>` for universal. **Do not trust Trivy's
  title field alone**: it sometimes references a *different* CVE in its text, which
  silently steers a careful but un-verified read to the wrong package. Memorable example
  (PR #23, caught by Codex P2): CVE-2026-39823's Trivy title began *"CVE-2026-27142
  fixed a vulnerability in which URLs were not correctly..."* — sounds like `net/url`,
  but Go vuln-DB / NVD record it as `html/template` (XSS via URLs inside `<meta>`
  content attribute). The outcome was unchanged (still safely waivable) but the
  *justification* named the wrong code path, which would mislead the next reviewer
  assessing "is this still safe?" The 2026-05-27 audit of pre-PR-23 waivers found 39/39
  package attributions correct, so this isn't yet a repo-wide pattern — but Codex's
  catch shows the failure mode exists and the check is cheap.
- **A CVE advisory can list *multiple* vulnerable ranges — confirm which one your installed
  version falls in.** A single advisory often carries one range per maintained release branch
  (e.g. a 4.2.x range *and* a 4.1.x range). Reading only the first range can wrongly conclude
  "not affected" when a *later* range covers your version. When the authoritative source is the
  GitHub Advisory DB, enumerate every range — `gh api /advisories -f cve_id=<CVE> --jq '.[] |
  .vulnerabilities[] | {package, vulnerable: .vulnerable_version_range, patched:
  .first_patched_version}'` lists them all (NVD may be RESERVED/empty and Aqua AVD may 404 for
  very fresh CVEs, so the GH Advisory DB is the reliable lookup). (M2.S4 PR #48: the netty
  CVE-2026-44249/45416 advisories' *first* range was `>= 4.2.0, <= 4.2.14`; Neo4j bundles
  netty 4.1.132 — only the *second* range `<= 4.1.134` (fixed 4.1.135) showed we were affected.
  Trusting the first range alone would have wrongly waved the image through as unaffected.)

## 6. Test discipline (root `CLAUDE.md` §2, `backend/CLAUDE.md`)

- Is there a **test for every new behavior**, and does it encode the spec (not just assert
  the happy path)? Were tests plausibly written first?
- **Agent tests use a mocked `LLMProvider`** — no real LLM/network in unit tests.
- Integration tests carry the `integration` marker; unit tests need no Postgres/network.
- Tests live in the mirrored path (`tests/unit/<src path>/`, `tests/integration/`,
  `tests/unit/agents/`). Credential-like literals bound to a variable (detect-secrets).
- Do the assertions actually exercise the risk found in step 1, or only the obvious case?
- **Render-test wrappers must be load-bearing.** Every provider / context / router /
  fixture wrapping a render test must be exercised by the asserted-on subtree, or by an
  explicit sentinel component that throws when the wrapper is absent (e.g. a tiny child
  calling `useQueryClient()` to fail loudly if no `QueryClientProvider` is in scope). A
  decorative wrapper makes the test pass whether or not the production composition is
  wired right — the test docstring then *overclaims* what it defends. Rule of thumb: if
  you can delete the wrapper from the test and the test still passes, the wrapper is a lie.
- **A new test runner / category / glob is wired into CI before merge.** If this PR adds
  a test framework (vitest, Playwright, a new pytest marker, a new file glob), check that
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` actually invokes it (`grep` the job for the runner name /
  npm script / pytest invocation). A test that runs only locally is half a test — it
  defends today's commit but not tomorrow's. Skipping this check structurally bypasses
  the test-driven rule for the session's headline artifact.

## 7. Portfolio hygiene (root `CLAUDE.md` → Public-portfolio hygiene)

The repo is public; every line is read by a stranger.

- Comments / docstrings / names written for an outsider; no `TODO: explain later`.
- No leftover scratch, commented-out code, or debug prints.
- Curated commit message + PR body that read as an intentional record.
- Generated artifacts (screenshots, sample graphs) under `docs/`, not the repo root.

## 8. Merge-readiness

- CI: all jobs green? If red, is it *pre-existing, unrelated, and diagnosed* (the only
  allowed exception per the green-main bar), and is that stated + tracked?
- Are deferred items tracked (a GitHub issue, a `docs/PLAN_SHORT.md` cross-cutting note, or — for
  a post-PoC feature/UX/refinement — a `docs/BACKLOG.md` entry), not silently dropped? Unrelated
  discoveries split out rather than scope-crept in?
- Have prior review notes (an earlier `/review-pr` or `/code-review` pass) been folded or explicitly deferred?
- **Same bug, different fixes — consider folding both.** When two review passes (`/review-pr`
  and `/code-review`) flag the **same bug class** but propose **different mechanisms**, the
  default isn't "pick one and mark the other duplicate" — it's *consider folding both as
  defense-in-depth*, especially when the bug is destructive (data loss, silent overwrite,
  unrecoverable state). Two passes converging on a class while diverging on
  mechanism is the signal the bug deserves belt-and-suspenders. Story Forge example:
  Session 6's empty-`raw_text` overwrite — `/review-pr` proposed a UI-layer disabled-button
  guard; Codex proposed a hook-layer drop-the-override-when-empty. Both landed (PR #18 +
  follow-up commit) because either alone could regress without the other catching it.
- **Sequential-Trivy unmask: don't declare "ready to merge" on the first green scan when
  the PR changes a Trivy waiver or image pin.** The `security` CI job scans images
  sequentially with `exit-code: 1`, so image N failing prevents Trivy from reaching image
  N+1; *fixing N can unmask fresh CVEs in N+1 that were hidden the whole time*. Pattern
  in this repo is 3-for-3:
    - Issue #2 (neo4j ubi10 pin) → unmasked pgvector CVE-staleness → Issue #4 (own PR)
    - Issue #4 (pgvector wave-1 waiver) → unmasked ollama 0.22.1 staleness → folded into PR #6
    - PR #23 (pgvector wave-3 waiver) → unmasked ollama wave-3 → folded into the same PR
  So: for **waiver-only PRs**, wait for the full CI run on the changed branch (not just
  the first scan to pass) before writing the review's merge-readiness verdict. For
  **pin-changing PRs**, the `/pin-image` skill already encodes "scan every image the
  security job covers up front" — that prerequisite doesn't disappear when the work is
  in a PR rather than a local scan. If you write the review while one scan is still
  red, *flag the unmask possibility explicitly* so the next reviewer expects it instead
  of treating it as a fresh surprise. (This unmask treadmill is **Trivy-only** — the
  `osv-scanner` lockfile scan reports every advisory in one pass, so it has no equivalent.)
- **An SCA waiver (`infra/osv/osv-scanner.toml` + `infra/osv/WAIVERS.md`) added without a
  fix-first justification, a mirror, or an expiry.** The backend SCA gate is fail-on-any, so
  a waiver is the *only* way to go green without a bump — scrutinise each one the way the Trivy
  waivers are scrutinised. Check: (1) **fix was genuinely unavailable** (no fixed version that
  clears the 14-day soak, or a parent range forbids the bump) — a waiver where a soaked fix
  exists is a `/add-dependency` bump in disguise; (2) the **enforced toml entry and the
  `WAIVERS.md` row mirror each other** (a row in one and not the other is the drift this split
  is designed to expose — same reconciliation lens as §2); (3) the advisory **ID is not typo'd**
  (a wrong/typo'd id silently suppresses nothing — confirm it matches the one CI actually
  reported); (4) the **reachability rationale is real** (not "low-risk on localhost" boilerplate)
  and a condition-based **"drop when"** is recorded. Prefer pushing back toward a fix.
- **The SCA scanner pin itself drifted.** The `osv-scanner` step pins the scanner by **immutable
  image digest** (not a tag — a tag can move; the gate that catches supply-chain risk must not be
  one). Flag a PR that swaps the digest for a tag, bumps the digest without a ≥7-day soak, or
  switches to an unpinned action.

## 9. Report

Give the user one structured close-out:

- **One-line summary** of the change and an overall read (ready / needs work / blocked).
- **Findings grouped by severity**, each with `file:line` and the rule/bug:
  - **Blocking** — a bug, a spec/decision contradiction, a §6.7 violation, missing tests for
    new behavior, or red CI without a sanctioned reason. Must fix before merge.
  - **Should-fix** — real problems that aren't merge-blockers (weak test coverage, an awkward
    but correct construction, a missing tracked-deferral note).
  - **Nit** — style/readability/polish; optional.
- **Checked and clean** — name the dimensions you verified and found fine, so a green review
  means something rather than "I didn't look."

Then stop. The user folds what they choose into the branch (this skill doesn't edit code or
merge). If they want findings as inline PR comments, point them at the `code-review` skill's
`--comment` mode rather than posting from here.

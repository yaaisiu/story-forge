# AGENTS.md — src/story_forge/

This is the application code. The most important rule: **layering**.

## Layering

```
api/         ← HTTP routes; thin, no business logic
agents/      ← orchestration modules — one logical task per file (chunking, extraction, judging, ...)
domain/      ← business logic, pure, no I/O, no HTTP
adapters/    ← I/O: DBs, LLMs, file system, external HTTP
prompts/     ← Jinja2 prompt templates, PL + EN variants, versioned in git
config.py    ← settings via pydantic-settings; reads .env
main.py      ← FastAPI app construction and wiring
```

**Rules:**
- `domain/` must not import from `api/`, `agents/`, or `adapters/`.
- `domain/` defines protocols (`typing.Protocol`) for what it needs; `adapters/` implements them.
- `agents/` may import from `domain/` and from the `LLMProvider` Protocol — never from a concrete adapter.
- `api/`, `agents/`, and `adapters/` are wired in `main.py` via dependency injection.
- A test of a `domain/` module must not need a database or network. An agent test must not need a real LLM — it gets a mocked `LLMProvider`.

If you find yourself wanting to import `httpx` or `neo4j` in `domain/` or `agents/`: stop. Add a protocol. Implement in `adapters/`.

## API routes

`api/` routes are thin HTTP wrappers around `agents/` and `domain/`. Two rules that
authoring (not just reviewing) needs to hold:

- **Declare every non-2xx outcome.** Every `HTTPException` a route raises (or maps from a
  domain exception) must have a matching entry on the decorator's
  `responses={status: {"model": ErrorResponse, "description": "..."}}` — and there must be
  exactly one shared `ErrorResponse(BaseModel)` (with `detail: str`) that all routes use.
  Without `responses=`, the OpenAPI schema shows only the success status + the
  auto-generated 422 validation error; the typed TypeScript client at
  `frontend/src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` then can't model the failure paths the frontend has
  to handle (the documented 409 re-structure conflict, a 404, a 502 from an unreachable
  LLM, …). After adding or changing a route, walk every `raise HTTPException(...)` in its
  body and confirm the status appears in `responses=`; then regenerate the snapshot
  (`backend/scripts/dump_openapi.py` → `npm run generate:api`) so the contract is visible
  in the next PR diff.
- **The 422 trap.** FastAPI auto-attaches 422 to every route for request-validation
  errors with shape `HTTPValidationError`. If your route *also* raises an explicit
  `HTTPException(status_code=422, ...)` for a domain-level error (e.g. "input too long"),
  declaring 422 in `responses=` would clobber the validation shape with `{detail: str}`
  and break the typed client's discrimination of the two cases. Either (a) remap the
  domain error to a different status code (413 "payload too large" fits "input too long"
  honestly), or (b) leave 422 out of `responses=` and track the overload as a cross-cutting
  follow-up. Don't quietly overwrite the validation shape.

## LLM adapter

`adapters/llm/` follows the three-tier strategy from spec §6.5 (provider order + scope: `docs/decisions/0003`):
- `OllamaProvider` serves both local small (host=localhost:11434) and cloud free (host=ollama.com with API key)
- `OpenRouterProvider` — the **preferred paid route** (one OpenAI-compatible endpoint reaching Grok/Claude/Gemini/GPT); **the only paid adapter built in M2.S2**
- `AnthropicProvider`, `GrokProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, `OpenAIProvider` — direct paid adapters, **built as needed** (deferred past M2.S2)
- all adapters are hand-rolled over `httpx` (no vendor SDKs), mirroring `OllamaProvider`'s injectable-transport shape
- `router.py` decides which tier per call and handles cross-provider failover within a tier

## Agents

`agents/` contains the orchestration modules from spec §6.5. Each agent module owns:

- one logical task (chunking, extraction, judging, ...)
- the Pydantic input/output schemas for that task
- a thin orchestration function: load prompt → call router → parse + validate → retry on failure
- the prompt template lives in `prompts/<agent>.<lang>.j2` (never as f-strings in code)

To add a new agent: copy an existing one, change the prompt + schema, register its preferred tier. No god-class to edit.

**Output-parsing helpers shared across agents live in `agents/json_output.py`, not
duplicated per agent.** `extract_json` (strip a model's markdown code fence before
Pydantic) is used by `ChunkingAgent`, `ExtractionAgent`, and `JudgeAgent`; the moment a
second agent needed it, it moved out of the agent module into the shared helper rather
than being copy-pasted.

**The validate-and-retry loop is shared via `agents/validation.py`
(`validate_with_retry`), folded at the rule-of-three.** The `call → extract_json →
validate-against-schema → retry-on-ValidationError → give-up` loop was copied per-agent
through n=2 (Chunking + Extraction, deliberately left per-copy); `JudgeAgent` was the
third, so the mechanical loop moved into one helper. Each agent still owns the parts that
are genuinely its own — its **schema** (passed as `model`), its **call shape** (the
`call` thunk: a raw provider vs the router, the weight/`task_type`), and its **give-up
error** (`error` + `label`). Only the schema-agnostic loop mechanics are shared. The
router-shaped collaborator each router-driven agent types against is the `Router` Protocol
in `adapters/llm/base.py` (promoted there from a per-agent local mirror at the same n=3),
alongside the `TaskWeight` literal — so an agent stays free of the concrete `router`
module while `LLMRouter` structurally satisfies the Protocol.

**Make an agent's give-up error *total* when a consumer fail-closes on it.** `validate_with_retry`
raises the agent's give-up error only on *schema* give-up; the router's terminal **transport/
envelope** failures (`httpx.HTTPError`, `ProviderResponseError`) and the pause-and-ask control
signals (`BudgetExceededError`/`QuotaExhaustedError`) propagate *past* it, raw. That is correct at
the API boundary (a route maps each to its own status). But when another component **fail-closes**
on the agent — catching its give-up error to route a candidate to the human rather than crash — that
`except` sees only the schema give-up, so a *provider-unreachable* failure escapes the fail-closed
branch. Fix it at the agent: wrap the `validate_with_retry` call so a terminal
`(ProviderResponseError, httpx.HTTPError)` is re-raised as the agent's give-up error (let Budget/
Quota keep propagating — they are the pause signal, not an "I couldn't produce output" signal). Then
the agent's give-up error means "could not produce output, for any reason except pause", and a
consumer fail-closes on one exception type. (M3.S4a / PR #63: the cascade caught only `JudgeError`,
so a judge-provider outage 502'd the whole batch instead of staging the candidate as uncertain;
`JudgeAgent.judge` now converts transport→`JudgeError`. Review-side mirror: `/review-pr` §1.)

**Deterministic local NLP is an exception to "no concrete deps in agents."** The
layering rule above ("agents import the `LLMProvider` Protocol, never a concrete
adapter") targets network/DB I/O and the multi-provider LLM tier. `PreNERAgent`
imports spaCy directly (lazily, in `_pipeline`) because it is deterministic, purely
local compute with no provider choice to abstract — a Protocol would be ceremony for
a single implementation (Karpathy: no abstractions for single-use code). The reusable
logic that *doesn't* need spaCy (`candidates_from_entities`, `map_spacy_label`) is
factored into pure functions so it stays CI-testable without the model. **Revisit
this** if a second NER backend ever appears (e.g. a finetuned model alongside the
stock pipelines) — at that point a `NerPipeline` Protocol earns its place.

## Prompts

Prompts live in `prompts/` as Jinja2 templates (`.j2`). One file per logical prompt. Versioned in git. Loaded via a small helper, not f-strings scattered around the code. Both PL and EN variants per prompt.

**Build a prompt from the spec's Appendix C template, not the §3 prose alone.** Each agent's prompt is described in *two* spec homes: the §3 functional prose (e.g. §3.3 "candidate in context vs existing entity + its properties + recent mentions") and the **Appendix C** concrete template (e.g. C.3 with its exact `[SYSTEM]`/`[USER]` blocks and full field list). Both are spec; **Appendix C is the authoritative, complete field set** — the prose summarises. When authoring or changing a prompt, render every field the Appendix C template lists and cross-check §3, then assert each field reaches the model in a test. (M3.S3 lesson: the judge prompt was built from §3.3's prose and silently dropped C.3's existing-entity `aliases` — the exact diminutive signal Stage 3 exists to use — plus the candidate `type`/`properties`; the single `/review-pr` missed it, the multi-agent `/code-review` caught it. The review-side mirror is in `/review-pr` §2.)

## Common pitfalls to avoid here

- Don't fetch from Neo4j inside an API route handler. Go through the domain.
- Don't accept LLM JSON output without Pydantic validation. Always parse, always retry on parse failure.
- Don't write a "smart" function in `domain/` that has side effects. Side effects belong in adapters.
- Don't inline a prompt in an agent module. It belongs in `prompts/`.

"""EntityEditService — the human edit-handler for committed graph state (M4.S3a, DM-S3a-1/2/3).

The first slice that *edits* already-committed graph objects. It is a new **human-reached** graph
writer alongside the accept handler (`CandidateReviewService`, nodes) and the decide handler
(`RelationReviewService`, staged-relation edges) — the reason INV-9's wording broadens from
"exactly two writers" to "only human-reached handlers — accept, decide, edit" (ADR 0006). The
guarded property is unchanged: no *automated* stage writes the graph; every writer is reached only
from an explicit human action.

Per the owner's build-time call (DM-S3a-3, the synthetic-staged-row path didn't compose — the
decide path resolves endpoints by surface-name-within-a-paragraph, which a hand-picked edge has
neither of), manual relation add/remove write Neo4j **directly** here (`create_relation` reused for
add, `delete_relation` for remove), so the edge-writer set grows under the same INV-9 rewording.

Write order mirrors the accept/decide services — **graph mutation first, evidence row last**
(DM-S3a-2, INV-3). A crash between them leaves the edit applied but unlogged; a retry of the same
edit re-reads the now-updated state, diffs empty, and is a clean no-op — so nothing is double-
applied (the narrow cost is a missed audit row in that window, accepted at PoC for one local author,
last-write-wins — DM-S3a-6).
